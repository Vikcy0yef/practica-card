  <h3 class="item-title">I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so,
  in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.</h3>
  <p class="desc">“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a
  transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up
  for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
  The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing
  the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”</p>

      experiences was easy.</h3>
      <p class="desc">“ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program gave me the
      confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable junior developer. The standard is
      above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing people. ”</p>

      <h3 class="item-title">Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</h3>
      <p class="desc">“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can
      help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say
      wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I
      never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to
      the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an
      example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving
      multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”</p>
